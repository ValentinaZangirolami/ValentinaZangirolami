- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ValentinaZangirolami
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in  data analysis and statistics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently continue learning on Data Science
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: valentina.zangirolami@gmail.com

My main interests lies in the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques. I'm, also, very interested on the bayesian inference.
In this last year, I focused on application of Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques. I'm very stimulated to study this architectures and their applications!

I hope to continue learning and to discover more and more on the world of Data Science!
